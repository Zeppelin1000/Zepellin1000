## Aspsiring Data Analyst / Data Scientist

Welcome to my GitHub home page. I have only recently set this up, but am excited by how this site is impacting the modern technology community. It is obviously a brilliant resource for coders and project managers in many different industries and is a very effective tool enabling teams to work in a distributed way.

I have recently finished a 4 month Bootcamp with Hyperion Dev and I am looking to land a role in the tech industry.  The content covered on the course included the following;

+ Python programming (all technical tasks carried out in Python(VSC)
+ 53 assignments including 7 project assignments
+ EDA, Data Analysis and Data Visualisation using a variety of libraries and Tableau
+ Writing both procedural, iterative and OO code in a variety of systems
+ SQL and SQLite 
+ ML (regression,  decision trees, image processing, clustering and PCA)
+ Basics of GitHub.

In addition to the above, I have recently gained certification in Data Analysis with Python from the freeCodeCamp  https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc467aa05a-75fc-4b9a-92d6-8db59e8ed06f/data-analysis-with-python-v7

Please see details of a project I did on clustering and PCA here: https://github.com/Zeppelin1000/finalCapstone
